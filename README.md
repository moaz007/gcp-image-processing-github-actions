# Serverless Image Processing API


This project is a serverless image processing API built with Node.js (v20.19.0) using the Google Cloud SDK and Cloud Functions. It leverages GCP Cloud Functions (Gen 2) for executing functions, along with GitHub Actions for automated continuous integration and deployment.

The API accepts a base64-encoded image and file name in a JSON payload, processes the image (resizes it to 300Ã—300 pixels and converts it to JPEG), and stores the resulting image in designated Cloud Storage buckets.

This repository contains all the necessary configurations and scripts for deploying the project on GCP, and demonstrates a modern, automated CI/CD workflow.
